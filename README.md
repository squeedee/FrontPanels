How to make panels for eurorack etc, quickly.

# Why

In [agile software design](http://www.agilemanifesto.org), we hold on to some simple ideas, that help us get to sucessful products quickly and cheaply. The ones that apply to my experiences with hardware design are:

* Working product over comprehensive documentation
* Responding to change over following a plan

Which I like to cover with:

* Continuous delivery. Try and have something useable in a very short period of time
* Welcome changes by leaving room in your process to adapt
* Sustainable design, don't wait to make things better for the next time you visit the work.

When I go to build out something for my Eurorack, I want to itterate on my design and get quick feedback on feasability.
For this reason, I need materials costs to be low, at least in the high-churn early phases. 
I also need a quick way to mock up and try a layout.

# Dont

Do not get a [Dremel](https://www.dremel.com/en-us/Tools/Pages/CategoryProducts.aspx?catid=2013). It's just not worth it.

It's an expensive toy that's addons are full of [backlash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backlash_(engineering)). 

The dremel rotary tool itself isn't too bad, but it's plastic and prone to wear. It's also [gutless](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=gutless).

I bought the [plunge router attachment](https://www.dremel.com/en-us/Attachments/Pages/ProductDetail.aspx?pid=335-01) and the [drill press](https://www.dremel.com/en-us/Attachments/Pages/ProductDetail.aspx?pid=220-01), so I went all in... just a waste of money.
